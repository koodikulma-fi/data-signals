 *          * The actual values can be anything: static values, functions, arrays, maps, sets, custom classes (including Immutable maps and such).

 *          * Accordingly you should not refer deeper on the JS either, even thought it might work in practice since won't take a shallow copy of non-Objects.
 * - Contexts are useful in complex applications and often shared non-locally (or down the tree) in app structure to provide common data and intercommunication channels.
 *      * For example, you might have several different contexts in your app, and then interconnect them together (if needed).
 * - Contexts are designed to function stand alone, but also to work with ContextAPI instances to sync a bigger whole together.
 *      * The contextAPIs can be connected to multiple named contexts, and listen to data and signals in all of them in sync.
